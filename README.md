# MTB-SHIELD

## Introduction

**MTB-SHIELD** is a high-performance software package developed to **predict antibiotic resistance** in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (MTB) using machine learning. It supports prediction across **13 antibiotic drug classes**, including:

Amikacin (AMI), Bedaquiline (BDQ), Clofazimine (CFZ), Delamanid (DLM), Ethambutol (EMB), Ethionamide (ETH), Isoniazid (INH), Kanamycin (KAN), Levofloxacin (LEV), Linezolid (LZD), Moxifloxacin (MXF), Rifampicin (RIF), Rifabutin (RFB)

## Use Cases

This README outlines two primary use cases:

- **Running the pre-trained classifiers** (recommended for most users):  
  The `MTB-SHIELD.py` script is designed for this purpose. It provides a lightweight interface that requires no GPU resources and can be executed using a single CPU core. The script supports parallel execution, making it suitable for large-scale antibiotic resistance studies.

- **Rebuilding the classifiers from raw sequencing data** (intended for advanced users):  
  This workflow enables researchers to develop custom AI-based models and software in a *de novo* fashion. It offers a robust foundation for exploring novel approaches to antimicrobial resistance prediction.
