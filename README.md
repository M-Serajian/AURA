# MTB-SHIELD

## Introduction
MTB-SHIELD is a software developed to predict antibiotic resistance in MTB bacteria using machine learning for 13 groups of antibiotics including Amikacin, Bedaquiline, Clofazimine, Delamanid, Ethambutol, Ethionamide, Isoniazid, Kanamycin, Levofloxacin, Linezolid, Moxifloxacin, Rifampicin, Rifabutin. This README contains instructions on how to run the pre-trained classifier or to rebuild the classifier from raw data.




[Rebuilding](https://github.com/M-Serajian/) is an advanced use case.  We expect most users to only run the trained classifier.   This software is maintained by m.Serajian (ma.serajian@gmail.com).  Please post an issue on GitHub if there are any problems with the compilation of the code.

## Installation ##
Two methods of installation are considered for MTB++ according to the user's preference. [Automatic Installation](...), and [Manual Installation](...). In case your system supports the "module load" environment, you can use the Automatic Installation, otherwise, Manual Installation is recommended. 


Here is the dependencies required for using the pre-trained models. 



#### Dependencies ####

* [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.0+ (3.8+ recommended)
* [Cmake](https://cmake.org/)(tested on v3.26.4)
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (12.2 recommended)
